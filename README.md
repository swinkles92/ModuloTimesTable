Name: Modulo Times Table

Version: 1.0 / Final

Author: Sam Winkles

This program takes user input in the forms of text boxes
and sliders to construct a visualization of a Modulo
Times Table. The user can start/pause the animation as
well as select from a list of my favorite designs to
populate the diagram.

Bugs & Known Issues:

The "Delay by" slider is bugged, it can speed up
the program but not slow it down.

There exists some redundant code, particularly in the
creation of the line diagram.
